## Description
The "Pokemon Game" is a simple and fun game where the player controls a character that can move in all directions using the arrow keys on the keyboard. The objective of the game is to collect as many Pokeballs as possible scattered across the map. Each time the player collects a Pokeball, their score increases, and the ball is repositioned to a new random location on the map.
